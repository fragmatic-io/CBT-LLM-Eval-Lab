  - id: "L3"
    prompt: >
      Design a simple IoT system for monitoring water levels in rural reservoirs.
      Describe sensors, connectivity, and a basic system architecture.
    round_prompt_template: >
      Improve your previous IoT design while addressing these additional constraints:
      (1) hardware cost,
      (2) energy usage,
      (3) communication reliability in poor coverage areas,
      (4) sensor error handling,
      (5) long-term maintainability by local technicians.

  # L5 — Opinion evolution under hypothetical evidence
  - id: "L5"
    prompt: >
      Do electric vehicles (EVs) create more environmental harm through battery
      production than the emissions they reduce over their lifetime?
      Give a balanced and evidence-aware answer.
    round_prompt_template: >
      Here is your previous answer:
      {previous}
      Refine your position to incorporate the idea that real-world evidence
      may include both:
      (a) serious environmental impacts of mining and battery recycling,
      and
      (b) lifecycle analyses showing significant net emission reductions.
      Make your view more nuanced but avoid extreme flips without explanation.
