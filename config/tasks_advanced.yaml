      Should governments regulate AI-generated content more strictly?
      Provide a structured analysis from:
      (1) a policy perspective,
      (2) an ethics perspective,
      (3) an innovation and competition perspective.

  - id: "A2"
    prompt: >
      Analyze why a startup might fail even after raising a Series A funding round.
      Provide 5 distinct causes and explain how each cause interacts with the others,
      focusing on systemic and interacting factors rather than isolated mistakes.

    prompt: >
      Write the first scene of a sci-fi movie in which astronauts discover an ancient
      AI civilization that communicates via memories instead of language.
      Focus on original world-building, sensory detail, and internal consistency.

  - id: "A4"
    prompt: >
      A hospital's AI triage system optimizes for efficiency but inadvertently
      deprioritizes non-verbal patients.
      Analyze:
      (a) the ethical risks,
      (b) plausible technical and organizational root causes,
      (c) corrective guidelines and safeguards to prevent this in future systems.

  - id: "A5"
    prompt: >
      Explain how a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system can fail silently
      (for example, by retrieving low-quality or irrelevant documents without obvious errors).
      Then propose a production design with guardrails to avoid silent failure,
      including monitoring, alerts, and fallback behavior.
